The GEOROC Database (Geochemistry of Rocks of the Oceans and Continents) is a comprehensive collection of published analyses of igneous and metamorphic rocks and minerals. It contains major and trace element concentrations, radiogenic and nonradiogenic isotope ratios as well as analytical ages for whole rocks, glasses, minerals and inclusions. Metadata include geospatial and other sample information, analytical details and references.

The GEOROC Database was established at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz (Germany). In 2021, the database was moved to Göttingen University, where it continues to be curated as part of the DIGIS project of the Department of Geochemistry and Isotope Geology at the Geoscience Centre (GZG) and the University and State Library (SUB). Development for GEOROC 2.0 includes a new data model for greater interoperability, options to contribute data, and improved access to the database.

As part of the DIGIS project, a new API interface has been created for the GEOROC database, allowing easy access to its contents with simple programming skills. Users can now query the database and retrieve data using the new API, making it more accessible and useful for researchers and other interested parties. This notebook demonstrates the basic capabilities of GEOROC data access via the new DIGIS API.

# Jupyter-Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook created are specifically designed to illustrate the features of GEOROC 2.0. They focus on data access via the API, followed by suggested workflows for data formatting, cleansing, resampling, and presentation. They were first used to test the API and ensure its functionality.

The Jupyter Notebook are divided into two specific categories:

1. The first part is focused on demonstrating how to send API requests. It illustrates how users can query the API and retrieve data from the GEOROC database. The examples in this notebook cover a wide range of API requests and demonstrate the usability and accessibility of the new API.

2. The second part focuses on general methods for data cleansing. It illustrates how data retrieved from the API can be cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted for further analysis. The methods presented in this notebook are universal and can be applied to all types of data retrieved from the GEOROC database.

3. The third part focuses on data visualization and includes a detailed reconstruction of a geochemical publication. This notebook illustrates how the cleaned and formatted data can be visualized to provide valuable insight and interpretation. It illustrates various methods of data visualization and how they can be used to present results in a clear and understandable manner.

Each of these parts includes detailed tutorials and explanations to help users understand the functionality of the API and the processes of data cleaning and visualization.
