The GEOROC Database (Geochemistry of Rocks of the Oceans and Continents) is a comprehensive collection of published analyses of igneous and metamorphic rocks and minerals. It contains major and trace element concentrations, radiogenic and nonradiogenic isotope ratios as well as analytical ages for whole rocks, glasses, minerals and inclusions. Metadata include geospatial and other sample information, analytical details and references.

The GEOROC Database was established at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz (Germany). In 2021, the database was moved to Göttingen University, where it continues to be curated as part of the DIGIS project of the Department of Geochemistry and Isotope Geology at the Geoscience Centre (GZG) and the University and State Library (SUB). Development for GEOROC 2.0 includes a new data model for greater interoperability, options to contribute data, and improved access to the database.

As part of the DIGIS project, a new API interface has been created for the GEOROC database, allowing easy access to its contents with simple programming skills. Users can now query the database and retrieve data using the new API, making it more accessible and useful for researchers and other interested parties. This notebook demonstrates the basic capabilities of GEOROC data access via the new DIGIS API.

# Jupyter-Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook created are specifically designed to illustrate the features of GEOROC 2.0. They focus on data access via the API, followed by suggested workflows for data formatting, cleansing, resampling, and presentation. They were first used to test the API and ensure its functionality.

The first part focuses on demonstrating the process of sending API requests. It illustrates how users can query the API and retrieve data from the GEOROC database. The examples covered in this notebook encompass a wide range of API requests, showcasing the usability and accessibility of the new API.

The second part revolves around general techniques for data formatting. It explains how the retrieved data from the GEOROC database can be prepared, cleansed, and formatted for further analysis. The methods presented in this notebook are universally applicable and can be employed for all types of data retrieved from the database.

The third part concentrates on data visualization and includes a detailed reconstruction of a geochemical publication. This notebook exemplifies how the formatted and cleansed data can be visualized to provide valuable insights and interpretations. It showcases various methods of data visualization and their effective utilization in presenting results in a clear and understandable manner.
