The GEOROC Database (Geochemistry of Rocks of the Oceans and Continents) is a comprehensive collection of published analyses of igneous and metamorphic rocks and minerals. It contains major and trace element concentrations, radiogenic and nonradiogenic isotope ratios as well as analytical ages for whole rocks, glasses, minerals and inclusions. Metadata include geospatial and other sample information, analytical details and references.

The GEOROC Database was established at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz (Germany). In 2021, the database was moved to GÃ¶ttingen University, where it continues to be curated as part of the DIGIS project of the Department of Geochemistry and Isotope Geology at the Geoscience Centre (GZG) and the University and State Library (SUB). Development for GEOROC 2.0 includes a new data model for greater interoperability, options to contribute data, and improved access to the database.

As part of the DIGIS project, a new API interface has been created for the GEOROC database, allowing easy access to its contents with simple programming skills. Users can now query the database and retrieve data using the new API, making it more accessible and useful for researchers and other interested parties. This notebook demonstrates the basic capabilities of GEOROC data access via the new DIGIS API.

# Jupyter-Notebook

We have created a Jupyter notebook specifically designed to illustrate the features of GEOROC 2.0. Our main focus is on data access via the API, after which we follow suggested workflows for data formatting, cleaning, resampling, and presentation.

The first part of the notebook illustrates the process of sending API requests. It shows how users can query the API and retrieve data from the GEOROC database. The examples covered in this notebook cover API requests and demonstrate the usability and accessibility of the new API. 
The second part is all about general data formatting techniques. It explains how to prepare, clean, and format data retrieved from the GEOROC database for further analysis.
The third and final part focuses on data visualization and includes a detailed reconstruction of a geochemical publication. More specifically, we reconstructed the publication "Major Element, Volatile and stable Isotope geochemistry of Hawaiian submarine tholeiitic glasses" by Garcia et al. (1989). This notebook illustrates how the formatted and cleaned data can be visualized to provide valuable insight and interpretation. It demonstrates various methods of data visualization and their effective use to present results in a clear and understandable manner.
